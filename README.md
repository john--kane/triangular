## Documentation

Get started with Triangular, learn the fundamentals and explore advanced topics on our documentation website.

## Development Setup


### Prerequisites

- Install [Node.js] which includes [Node Package Manager][npm]

### Setting Up a Project

Install Triangular globally:

```
npm install -g triangular
```

Create workspace:

```
tri new [PROJECT NAME]
```

Run the application:

```
cd [PROJECT NAME]
tri serve
```

### Testing Local Changes

If you are contributing to this repository and want to test your changes, you can build the CLI locally and install it in your project.

To make a local build:

```shell
pnpm build --local
```

This generates tarballs in the `dist/` directory. To use these locally built tools in another repository, install the generated packages:

```shell
cd path/to/example-project
npm install -D path/to/triangular/dist/*.tgz
```

When using the CLI in that project, it will automatically use the local build.

### Using the 'tri' command

When you install Triangular globally, you can use the `tri` command just like `ng`:

```shell
tri build
```

### Verifying against Official Tools

To verify your local changes, you can compare the output of a build using your local CLI with one using the official version.

1. **Create a baseline build:**
   In your example project, ensure you are using the official version (e.g., from npm) and run a build:
   ```shell
   # Using official package
   npm install @angular/cli@latest
   npm run build
   mv dist dist-official
   ```

2. **Create a comparison build:**
   Install your local build tarballs as described above and run the build again:
   ```shell
   # Using local built @angular/cli
   npm install -D path/to/angular-cli/dist/*.tgz
   npm run build
   mv dist dist-local
   ```

3. **Compare the results:**
   You can now compare the two directories to see the differences in the generated bundles:
   ```shell
   diff -r dist-official dist-local
   ```
   Note: Some differences are expected due to timestamps, randomly generated hashes, or minor version differences in dependencies. Focus on the actual JavaScript content changes.
   
### Benchmarking `tri` vs Others

To benchmark the performance improvements of `tri` (OXC-based) against official tools, you can follow these steps.

#### 1. Prepare your environment
Ensure you have a project to test with. For consistent results, it is recommended to run benchmarks on a "cold" build (after removing `dist` and `.angular` folders).

#### 2. Simple Benchmarking using `time`
You can use the built-in `time` command to get basic timing information.

**Baseline (Official):**
```shell
# Ensure official CLI is installed
npm install @angular/cli@latest
rm -rf dist .angular
time npx ng build
```

**Comparison (Tri):**
```shell
# Ensure local triangular builds are installed
npm install -D path/to/triangular/dist/*.tgz
rm -rf dist .angular
time npx ng build
```

#### 3. Advanced Benchmarking using `hyperfine`
For more accurate and statistically significant results, we recommend using [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine).

First, create two separate directories or use a way to switch between versions easily. A good approach is to have two identical projects: `project-official` and `project-triangular`.

```shell
hyperfine --prepare 'rm -rf dist .angular' \
  --name "Official CLI" "cd project-official && npx ng build" \
  --name "Triangular (OXC)" "cd project-triangular && npx ng build"
```

#### 4. Interpreting Results
`tri` focuses on speeding up the transpilation phase of the build. In large projects with many TypeScript files, you should see a noticeable decrease in the "Building..." phase of the CLI output.

Triangular is cross-platform, fast, scalable, has incredible tooling, and is loved by many.
