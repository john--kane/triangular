## Development Setup


### Prerequisites

- Install [Node.js] which includes [Node Package Manager][npm]

### Setting Up a Project

Install the Angular CLI globally:

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Create workspace:

```
ng new [PROJECT NAME]
```

Run the application:

```
cd [PROJECT NAME]
ng serve
```

### Testing Local Changes

If you are contributing to this repository and want to test your changes against an Angular project, you can build the CLI locally and install it in your project.

To make a local build:

```shell
pnpm build --local
```

This generates tarballs in the `dist/` directory. To use these locally built tools in another repository, install the generated packages:

```shell
cd path/to/example-project
npm install -D path/to/angular-cli/dist/*.tgz
```

When using the CLI in that project, it will automatically use the local build.

### Using the name 'triangular'

If you want to call the local build as `triangular` instead of `ng`, you have a few options:

#### 1. Using an Alias
After installing the local tarballs in your project as described above, you can create a shell alias:
```shell
alias triangular='npx ng'
triangular build
```

#### 2. Running the local binary directly
You can also invoke the locally built CLI directly without installing it into a project:
```shell
node path/to/triangular/dist/@angular/cli/bin/ng.js build
```

#### 3. Global Alias
To use `triangular` globally, you can add the alias to your shell profile (e.g., `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`):
```shell
alias triangular='node path/to/triangular/dist/@angular/cli/bin/ng.js'
```

### Verifying against Official Angular

To verify your local changes against the official Angular CLI, you can compare the output of a build using your local CLI with one using the official version.

1. **Create a baseline build:**
   In your example project, ensure you are using the official Angular CLI version (e.g., from npm) and run a build:
   ```shell
   # Using official @angular/cli
   npm install @angular/cli@latest
   npm run build
   mv dist dist-official
   ```

2. **Create a comparison build:**
   Install your local build tarballs as described above and run the build again:
   ```shell
   # Using local built @angular/cli
   npm install -D path/to/angular-cli/dist/*.tgz
   npm run build
   mv dist dist-local
   ```

3. **Compare the results:**
   You can now compare the two directories to see the differences in the generated bundles:
   ```shell
   diff -r dist-official dist-local
   ```
   Note: Some differences are expected due to timestamps, randomly generated hashes, or minor version differences in dependencies. Focus on the actual JavaScript content changes.
   
### Benchmarking `triangular` vs Angular CLI

To benchmark the performance improvements of `triangular` (OXC-based) against the official Angular CLI, you can follow these steps.

#### 1. Prepare your environment
Ensure you have an Angular project to test with. For consistent results, it is recommended to run benchmarks on a "cold" build (after removing `dist` and `.angular` folders).

#### 2. Simple Benchmarking using `time`
You can use the built-in `time` command to get basic timing information.

**Baseline (Official):**
```shell
# Ensure official CLI is installed
npm install @angular/cli@latest
rm -rf dist .angular
time npx ng build
```

**Comparison (Triangular):**
```shell
# Ensure local triangular builds are installed
npm install -D path/to/angular-cli/dist/*.tgz
rm -rf dist .angular
time npx ng build
```

#### 3. Advanced Benchmarking using `hyperfine`
For more accurate and statistically significant results, we recommend using [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine).

First, create two separate directories or use a way to switch between versions easily. A good approach is to have two identical projects: `project-official` and `project-triangular`.

```shell
hyperfine --prepare 'rm -rf dist .angular' \
  --name "Official Angular CLI" "cd project-official && npx ng build" \
  --name "Triangular (OXC)" "cd project-triangular && npx ng build"
```

#### 4. Interpreting Results
`triangular` focuses on speeding up the transpilation phase of the build. In large projects with many TypeScript files, you should see a noticeable decrease in the "Building..." phase of the Angular CLI output.

Angular is cross-platform, fast, scalable, has incredible tooling, and is loved by millions.
